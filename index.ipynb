    "# Assigning Premise Categories\n",
    "I am mostly interested in distinguishing between two types of premises: the ones that sell coffee and are more likely to be open during the day (like coffee shops and bakeries) and the ones that sell beer and are more likely to open in the evenings (like pubs and restaurants). I therefore want to sort my premises into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Category 1: day-time places (coffee shops, bakeries, delis, ice-cream)\n",
    "Category 2: pubs, restaurants, fast-food and bars\n",
    "Category 3: everything else\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this I have two sources of information: the premise name and the type returned by OpenStreetMap. Looking at the data, we find that the type is good first indicator, but also that many places are labeled incorrectly or not at all. I therefor apply a two-step approach: i) Assign the category based on the OpenStreetMap type ii) Clean up the data using its name, where this steps overwrites step i). To clean up the data, I decided to overrule the OpenStreetMap classification if the premise name contains certain key elements (such as ‘cafe’, ‘coffee’ or similar for coffee shops and ‘restaurant’, ‘inn’ or similar for restaurant and pubs). This misclassifies for example Cafe Andaluz as coffee shop, but works decently well in most cases. Particularly it seems to most keep to the pattern of classifying as coffee shops places, which are likely to be open during the day, so it works for my purpose. Of course, with fewer than 400 entries, one could manually go through the list and assign the correct category to each and every one of the entries. However, I am interested in creating a process, which can be easily transfered to other places, therefore a manual intervention specifically taylored to Edinburgh’s scenery is not suitable."
